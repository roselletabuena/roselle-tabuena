## Introduction

Being assigned to a feature in a programming language you’ve never worked with before can feel intimidating.  
The expectations are the same—deliver quality code—but the syntax, tools, and patterns are unfamiliar.

So where do you start?

---

## Follow Existing Patterns — But Question Them

The first instinct is usually to follow the existing patterns in the codebase. This is often the right move since it reduces risk and keeps consistency.

However, problems arise when:

- The user story requires a **new pattern**
- Existing patterns are **confusing or undocumented**
- The code is written using **poor practices**

Blindly copying existing code can slow you down or introduce technical debt. Patterns should guide you—not trap you.

## Can AI Coding Assistants Help?

AI coding assistants are a huge help, especially during the familiarization phase. Syntax is rarely the real blocker. As long as you understand the foundations of programming, AI can help translate ideas into working code.

That said, AI alone is **not enough**.

Selecting existing code and asking AI for help works only if you understand:

- The goal of the feature
- The responsibilities of each layer
- How your change fits into the system

Building features just to “make them work” with AI won’t help long-term.  
Building features **with understanding**, assisted by AI, significantly boosts productivity.

Also, tokens are limited and costly—use them on the right tasks.

---

## Context Matters More Than Syntax

Before writing code, take time to understand the repository at a high level:

- What problem does this service solve?
- How does data flow through the system?
- Where does this feature belong?

If the repository is part of a **data pipeline**, an accessible flowchart is critical. Developers shouldn’t need to reach out to others just to understand the flow.

If the repository is **frontend-focused**, shared configurations (such as VS Code settings or linters) help enforce consistency and reduce friction across the team.

## Define Inputs and Outputs Early

Before building anything, always clarify the inputs and outputs.

### Inputs

Ask questions like:

- What are the inputs?
- Are there limitations or constraints?
- What triggers this logic?
- What is required vs optional?
- Should this be optimized for performance, even if it sacrifices readability?

### Outputs

Then define:

- What is the expected output?
- Who consumes it?
- What happens when something fails?

Clear input and output definitions prevent rework and misalignment.

---

## Collaborate Early and Often

When you’re new to a repository, following existing patterns is not enough.

- Consult **before** building
- Sync **during** implementation
- Use code reviews for validation—not discovery

Implementations often change due to hidden constraints or evolving requirements. Continuous communication ensures the solution stays on track.

---

## Dealing With Bad Existing Code

Sometimes, the existing codebase contains poor practices.

If improvements are low-risk, make them.  
If changes are risky—especially when there are no unit tests—avoid copying the bad patterns.

Instead:

- Communicate clearly with the team
- Explain why you’re not following certain implementations
- Be consistent in messaging, especially in large teams
- Review related PRs to avoid conflicting approaches

Not all legacy code should be treated as a standard.

---

## Final Thoughts

Working in an unfamiliar language is less about mastering syntax and more about understanding context, intent, and collaboration.

Use existing patterns wisely.  
Leverage AI responsibly.  
Communicate early and often.

That’s how you build features that last—no matter the language.
